=========

I am a web fan of new technology, creative innovations. Basically I love web design and creation using wordpress, php  and html.

I am a professional diploma holder of webmastering obtained in 2008 from FCPI institute in Paris. I did this in order to improve my
competence in the field of webmaster job. Even though I have a full time job in the Media and public relations, however I do webmastering and 
web designing, administration for my future when I get retired.

I have created, and manage many websites,  and also partenered with many website owners in order to build a network in terms of sharing traffics,
sponsorships, revenue etc. I often participate in webmaster forums such as sitepoint, digitalpoint forum in order to share
and learn more and more.

As I am not able to consider this profession as my fulltime job because of the tough competitions online in order to survive
and make my family happy and that's the reason why I have a fulltime job. I rather consider webmastering  a part time job 
because it asks a lot of time which I don't have for the time being.

But I am sure, it will pay one day, when I take my retirement and will be able to sacrifice all my hours to my favourite
future profession.

Basically, I am a domain name lover. I have a great collection of top premium dot com domain names which is often considered
online by top professionals as "internet real estates". I am very much optimistic about the value of my domain names.
I have even launched a couple of high PR websites such as
http://www.inciso.net
http://www.bollywoodwave.com
http://www.securejob.net
http://www.leweb11.com
http://www.zoomh2n.com
which I eventually will resell them in the future. And in the mean time, I keep on developing websites in order to please
google because the ranking matters a lot for me.

Lastly, I am kind of a pro in terms of Search Engine Optimisation of websites to rank higher in different search engines such a s
yahoo, google, bing, yandex, baidoo etc. I have done SEO job for many business website owners who are satisfied and am still doing
SEO job people who need my service.

As I said, I lack of time because of my fulltime job, I have a limited number of clients who I work for as a SEO manager who 
pay me extremely well.

I look forward to improve my competence more using github concept.

It's a great pleasure to share my experience with github community.

have fun!
